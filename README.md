# keri-acdc

Some basic KERI/ACDC code.

Features:
- Partial (Custodial) Rotation
- Fully-Compacted ACDCs
- Nested Partial Disclosure

The example code doesn't include any edges, but the source/edges code should work (we use it at
Qui).

The data store included in the example code is pretty basic and not performant. It's only there
to provide glue code for the example to work.
